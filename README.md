# Harris Corner Detector

The Harris corner detector is a corner detection operator commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners and infer features of an image. It was first introduced by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988 as an improvement to Moravec's corner detector. Compared to its predecessor, the Harris corner detector takes the differential of the corner score into account with reference to direction directly, rather than using shifting patches for every 45-degree angle, and has proven to be more accurate in distinguishing between edges and corners. Since its introduction, the Harris corner detector has been improved and adopted in many algorithms to preprocess images for various applications.

## Introduction

A corner is a point whose local neighborhood stands in two dominant and different edge directions. In other words, a corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges, where an edge is a sudden change in image brightness. Corners are important features in images, often termed as interest points, which are invariant to translation, rotation, and illumination. Although corners constitute only a small percentage of the image, they contain the most important features for restoring image information, minimizing the amount of processed data for motion tracking, image stitching, building 2D mosaics, stereo vision, image representation, and other computer vision tasks.

Various corner detectors have been proposed to capture corners from images, including the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) operator and the Harris operator, both of which are simple, efficient, and reliable for corner detection. Compared to the KLT corner detector, the Harris corner detector provides good repeatability under changing illumination and rotation, making it more commonly used in stereo matching and image database retrieval. Despite some drawbacks and limitations, the Harris corner detector remains a fundamental technique in many computer vision applications.

## Development of the Harris Corner Detection Algorithm

The Harris corner detector algorithm can generally be divided into the following five steps:

1. **Color to Grayscale**: Convert the color image into a grayscale image to enhance processing speed.
2. **Spatial Derivative Calculation**: Compute the image gradients in the x and y directions.
3. **Structure Tensor Setup**: Formulate the structure tensor (or second moment matrix) using the image gradients.
4. **Harris Response Calculation**: Calculate the Harris response for each pixel to determine the likelihood of a corner.
5. **Non-maximum Suppression**: Perform non-maximum suppression to filter out non-corner points and identify true corners.

## Improvements

Over time, several improvements to the Harris corner detector have been developed, including:

- **Harris-Laplace Corner Detector**
- **Differential Morphological Decomposition-Based Corner Detector**
- **Multi-scale Bilateral Structure Tensor-Based Corner Detector**

## Applications

The Harris corner detector has been widely applied in various computer vision tasks, such as:

- Image Alignment, Stitching, and Registration
- 2D Mosaics Creation
- 3D Scene Modeling and Reconstruction
- Motion Detection
- Object Recognition
- Image Indexing and Content-Based Retrieval
- Video Tracking
